# GladiatusBot

Install tampermonkey (or greasemonkey etc...) to fire javascript file into and have fun

gladiatus UI must be in ENGLISH for bot to work!

For full functionality(quests and autoheal) i strongly suggest installing Gladiatus crazy addon (works even on android although youll have to add it to firefox acc collection and then install it on firefox nightly using developer mode) and turn these settings on:
- Double click items to consume them

Install Auto Refresh Plus in case network error occurs, after installing go to settings -> predefined -> predefined text and paste each one
